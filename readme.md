Paper CMS
======

**Description**

Paper CMS is intended to be a lightweight, text based CMS. The project is soley an experiement and learning experience for Object Oriented PHP programming, so it does not use any framework or foundation, instead it's made by scratch.

Again, just for fun and learning but feel free to pick it up, judge it, love it or hate it, make fun of it or build off of it!
